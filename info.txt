Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which means it is a condition that worsens
over time and is caused by the gradual loss of nerve cells in the brain. Primarily, it affects the part 
of the brain responsible for controlling movement.


Common Non-Motor Symptoms:

It's important to know that Parkinson's is more than just a movement disorder. It can cause a wide range of other issues, including:

- Speech Changes

- Loss of Smell (Anosmia)

- Cognitive Issues: Problems with memory, planning, and attention.

- Mood Disorders: Depression and anxiety are very common.

- Sleep Problems: Insomnia, fatigue, and acting out dreams.

- Constipation and Bladder Issues.

- PPE (Pitch Period Entropy):  PPE is a measure of the variability and complexity of the pitch in a person's voice

- spread1: This is a measure of the variation in the fundamental frequency of the voice 

- MDVP:Fo(Hz) (Average Vocal Fundamental Frequency): This is the average pitch of the voice, measured in Hertz (Hz).

- spread2: The fact that two different metrics for frequency spread are highly ranked emphasizes that the consistency and stability of vocal pitch are critically affected by the disease.

- MDVP:Flo(Hz) (Minimum Vocal Fundamental Frequency): This is the lowest pitch the voice reaches.

- Jitter:DDP: Jitter refers to the short-term variability in the fundamental frequency of the voice.

- NHR (Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio): This measures the ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice.
